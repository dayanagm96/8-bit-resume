# 8-bit-resume
This is my resume using NES style CSS framework.

This was one of my first projects when learning CSS. This was created using the NES.css framework, which has an 8-bit style. It was an incredibly fun project to create for somebody who grew up playing Nintendo's iconic video games like Mario or Pok√©mon. I also got helped with Grid while watching a tutorial on YouTube, I wouldn't say I'm more than a novice when talking about Grid, but I am still trying to learn.
